# MakeMore Replication

Following Andrej Karpathy's online resources exploring his MakeMore Project. Using this to learn and build ML/AI concepts.

First model is a simple system that determines the bigram probability then constructs names based on those probability. using a single layered neural net, we are able to train a model that achieves the same result, but with much more scalability for future improvement.
