# MakeMore Replication

Following Andrej Karpathy's online resources, I am exploring his MakeMore Project and using this to learn and build ML/AI concepts.

The first model is a bigram language model that uses bigram probability to construct names based on those probabilities. using a single-layered neural net, we are able to train a model that achieves the same result, but with much more scalability for future improvement.
